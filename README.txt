Welcome to the CyberSlug Evolutionary Dynamics Model Code - 6/21/2017
The program runs best in a FireFox browser which supports HTML 5
Run data will be saved as a Local Storage Object

Source code can be found in the "Generalized101sexVsRecombAll" file. Said code is not pretty
This code performs competition between Sexual Recombiners and Asexual Recombiners
This project initially served the purpose of adapting the NetLogo CyberSlug model into a webpage format 
As the project became more serious, many implementations were made to optimize its running speed but legacy code remained

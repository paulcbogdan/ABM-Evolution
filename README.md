  Our project aimed to illustrate that the principles of evolutionary dynamics will emerge from comparing reproduction modes by their abilities to evolve genetic algorithms.
    Below you will find a simulation between hermaphroditic sexual agents and asexual homologously recombining agents. Both evolve through natural selection. 
    Sexual reproduction is commonplace among vertebrates and taught as dominant. However, through our simulatory model we show conditions where evolution of unisexual lineages may occur. A paper outlining our methods, findings and a proposed cost on sexual reproduction is in submission.

To see a simulation (runs best in firefox), also zoom out and refresh:
